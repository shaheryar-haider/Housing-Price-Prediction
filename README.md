# Housing-Price-Prediction

# Introduction
This repository contains a Housing Price Prediction project that uses machine learning to predict housing prices based on various features and data. This README file serves as a guide to help you understand and work with the project.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately predict housing prices.To make these predictions, the project leverages a dataset containing various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, median income and more.

# Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
-data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. (housing.csv)
-notebooks: notebooks for data exploration and model development. (Visual Studio Code)
-README.md: The file you are currently reading, provides an overview of the project.

# Software
The software that was used during this project:
- Python (Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplot, and seaborn)
- Microsoft Excel (Power Query)


# Acknowledgments
I want to acknowledge and thank the creators of the dataset used in this project.

I appreciate your interest in this Housing Price Prediction project! We hope it is useful and insightful for your real estate or machine learning endeavors.
