# Housing-Price-Prediction

# Introduction
This repository contains a Housing Price Prediction project that uses machine learning to predict housing prices based on various features and data. This README file serves as a guide to help you understand and work with the project.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately predict housing prices.To make these predictions, the project leverages a dataset containing various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, median income and more.

# Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
-data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. (housing.csv)
-notebooks: notebooks for data exploration and model development. (Visual Studio Code)
-README.md: The file you are currently reading, provides an overview of the project.





# Acknowledgments
I want to acknowledge and thank the creators of the dataset used in this project.

Thank you for your interest in this Housing Price Prediction project! We hope it proves useful and insightful for your real estate or machine learning endeavors.
